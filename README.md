Hello there!

I am Shashank Srikanth, and welcome to my GitHub repository! I have housed projects here that I developed to enhance my skills in various domains, explore my interests, and simply have fun. Coding has always had the allure of magic for me, and I am constantly fascinated by just how versatile and powerful code can be in today's world.

I am currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Bellevue, where I am further pursuing my passion of developing efficient and robust code to solve problems that impact people on a global scale. In my free time, I read books from a variety of genres, binge watch Criminal Minds and Game of Thrones (we do not talk about Season 8 here), try cooking new recipes, and spend time with friends.

Feel free to reach out to me on my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashank-srikanth/

Happy coding!
